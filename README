-   What is SEAL?

    The Scorched End Audio Library (SEAL) is a C library (with Ruby binding)
    for 3D audio playback with built-in support for Ogg Vorbis, MPEG-1 and
    MPEG-2 Audio Layer I, II and III, and WAVE format. The major components of
    SEAL are based on OpenAL, a 3D sound rendering engine.

-   What Platforms and Compilers are supported?

    For SEAL itself, only Windows and POSIX-compliant platforms are supported.
    The third-party libraries libogg, libvorbis and libmpg123 define their own
    supported platforms. Windows and popular Un*x-like platforms are
    definitely supported by them, but please check the following links for
    up-to-date details.

    The third-party libraries that are redistributed in binary forms are for
    32-bit Linux and Windows; you can of course build your own versions of
    them for other supported platforms.

    The Makefiles are written specifically for MSVC and platforms with GCC
    and GNU make support (Un*x-like, MinGW, etc.). However, you should be able
    to build with other compilers given the above platform conditions are met
    as the code is portable across compilers.

-   How to Build?

    To build with GCC on Linux32, run `make RELEASE=1' under /gmake/linux32.
    To build with GCC + MinGW, run `make RELEASE=1' under /gmake/win32.
    To build with the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler, run `nmake' under /msvc.

    Note that these Makefiles do not add header dependencies for third-party
    libraries and other header files which are not expected to change.

    To build with the Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 IDE, use the solution file
    under /msvc.

-   Is SEAL Thread-safe?

    SEAL can be safely used in a multi-threaded environment so long as no SEAL
    source, buffer or stream instance is accessed by different threads at the
    *same time* , which is similar to libvorbis' thread-safety conditions
    described at:
        http://xiph.org/vorbis/doc/vorbisfile/threads.html
	
	Exceptions are the two functions `seal_startup' and `seal_cleanup', which
	are *NOT* thread-safe. Refer to the documentation for these two functions
	for details.

-   What character encoding should be used?

    UTF-8 should be used to encode the source code, or at least the path
    strings, so that SEAL can properly input audio files using paths that
    contain multibyte (Chinese, Japanese, etc.) characters.

-   How Can I redistribute SEAL?

    See COPYING.

-   Who is the Author?

    See AUTHOR.


-   What is Implied by "Scorched End"?

    The phrase "Scorched end" (Pinyin: Jiao Wei) is a direct tranlation of the
    name of a Guqin[1] existed in China in the second century. The name
    literally means that one end of the Qin is scorched.

    This Qin was found by Cai Yong.[2] According to the "History of the Later
    Han",[3] Cai Yong once heard very loud sound of someone burning Firmiana
    simplex[4] wood for cooking and realized that it is a good material for
    making Qin soundboards. He then asked for the wood and cut it into a Qin,
    and the sound it produced was pleasant to hear as expected. However, one
    end of the wood had already been scorched by the time Cai Yong got it,
    hence the name "Scorched end".

    SEAL was named so with the hope that it will be more useful than it seems
    and will be discovered by the right people who need the right tool.
